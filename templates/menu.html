            We were riding in my father’s pickup truck…
        </div>
        <div class="text">
    <p>on our way to the nearest library. There were no books where I grew up; you had to 

    travel to find books. I said to my father, “When I grow up I want to live where houses 
    
    are attached to each other.” I realize now I was longing for something  beyond our 
    
    enormous farm. Isolated, in Appalachia, I had imagined other worlds. Perhaps it was 
    
    those wide open fields and farmland, feral and free, that allowed my ideas to blossom, 
    
    along with the books that my father encouraged.</p>
    
    
    <p>I traveled first to California and eventually made my way to London. And it was
    
    there I found those houses “attached to each other,” and eleven-million people to keep 
    
    me company, just like I had dreamed of. </p>
    
    
<p>Peripatetic, an artist and lover of life, I lived abroad for almost two decades. Like a hard-
    
    won badge of honor, I cherished my Artist and Writer’s Visa. Europe was good to me.  
    
    I had followed my heart.</p>
    
    
<p>Years later, while working for a client in Northern California, I was asked to take a look 
    
    at their farm. An 1880’s vernacular Italian homestead, a heritage dry-farm vineyard, an 
    
    abandoned place, a farm gone fallow. Little did I know I was to follow the tradition of my 
    
    family and become a fifth generation farmer.</p>
    
<p>This is the story of a farm’s resurrection. </p>
  
<p>  “When the past meets the future, you know you are in the right place.”</p>
